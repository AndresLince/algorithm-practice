/**
    A vector type
    Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
    It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to
    properties of the same name.
    Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another
    vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or
    difference of the two vectors (this and the parameter) x and y values.
    Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length
    of the vectorâ€”that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin
    (0, 0).
